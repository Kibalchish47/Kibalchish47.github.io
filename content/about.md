Hello! I am Daniel Dia 👋

Welcome to my personal space on the web! 

I'm a Computer & Communications Engineering student at the American University of Beirut (AUB), driven by a fascination with the powerful intersection of mathematics 📈, software 💻, and quantitative finance 🧠.

My journey is grounded in a deep appreciation for theoretical foundations. I am particularly interested in the elegance of Mathematical Analysis and Linear Algebra, the predictive power of Probability & Statistics, and the structure of Dynamical Systems.

I am passionate about translating these advanced mathematical insights into practical, high-impact applications. My focus is on leveraging tools from Information Theory and Numerical Methods to tackle challenges in quantitative finance and build robust embedded software systems. I am also exploring how formal methods, drawing from logic and type theory, can be used with proof assistants to develop verifiably secure and robust machine learning models.

Ultimately, I believe in continuous learning as the key to solving complex problems and am committed to using technology to make a meaningful impact. 🚀

When I'm not working on this, you can find me studying history & political economy, playing guitar 🎸, reading 📚, and writing poetry ✍️.
