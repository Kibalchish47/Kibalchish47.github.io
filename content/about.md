Welcome to my personal space on the web! 👋 I'm Daniel, and this is where I'll share a bit about myself, my work, and things I'm learning.

---
I'm Daniel Dia, a CCE student at AUB, where I aim to integrate hardware and software approaches, combining my studies with a planned double major in Mathematics and a strong interest in Economics. 📈 My core passion involves applying techniques from pure and applied mathematics, especially probability theory and statistics, information theory, and machine learning models, to analyze and model complex systems, with a particular interest in fields like quantitative finance and embedded software.

I believe in continuous learning and applying advanced mathematical and technological insights to solve complex, real-world problems. 🚀

When I'm not working on this, you can find me studying history & political economy, playing guitar 🎸, reading 📚, and writing poetry ✍️.
