Welcome to my personal space on the web! 👋 I'm Daniel, and this is where I'll share a bit about myself, my work, and things I'm learning.

---
I'm Daniel Dia, a Computer & Communications Engineering (CCE) student at the American University of Beirut (AUB), where I aim to integrate hardware and software approaches, combining my studies with a planned double major in Mathematics and a strong interest in Economics and Finance. 📈

Excited to contribute technical skills and a community-focused mindset to information theory, dynamical systems, probability theory, statistical learning, and mathematics applied to quantitative finance and embedded (software) systems.

I believe in continuous learning and applying advanced mathematical and technological insights to solve complex, real-world problems. 🚀

When I'm not working on this, you can find me studying history & political economy, playing guitar 🎸, reading 📚, and writing poetry ✍️.
