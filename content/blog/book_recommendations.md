Alright, let's dive into some resources! I've put together a personally curated list of textbooks and other gems that I genuinely think are worth exploring. Full disclosure: this list is definitely shaped by my own experiences – some are treasured recommendations from professors I deeply respect, while others are simply books I've found incredibly enjoyable and insightful on my own journey. You'll also find links to other helpful bits like insightful blog posts or handy tutorials for that extra layer of understanding.

But here's a crucial piece of advice before you jump in: one of the most important things you can do is cultivate your own "mathematical taste." Seriously! What makes one textbook a page-turner for one person might feel like a slog to another. Some of us thrive on a narrative, intuitive approach (think the classic Feynman style), while others find the straightforward clarity of a theorem-corollary-proof structure the most illuminating. The key is figuring out what resonates with you!

# Mathematics

## Linear Algebra
A classic reference for linear algebra is **'Linear Algebra Done Right'** by Sheldon Axler.

## Single-Variable Calculus and Real Analysis
For those starting their calculus journey, a classic text that lays out the fundamentals in a clear and accessible manner is **Thomas' Calculus**. It's widely regarded as a standard choice for introductory calculus courses, and for good reason. The book is known for its intuitive explanations, wealth of examples, and its focus on helping students grasp the core concepts that underpin calculus.

If you're after a text that bridges the gap to more formal mathematical thinking, **Spivak's Calculus** is another excellent option. It was penned during a time when the distinction between "calculus" and "real analysis" wasn't as sharply drawn as it is today. Consequently, Spivak offers a rigorous treatment of calculus, perfect for those who want to engage with the subject with an early taste of real analysis-style rigor.

Venturing into the realm of real analysis itself, the often-mentioned classic is Walter Rudin's *Principles of Mathematical Analysis*, affectionately known as **Baby Rudin**. This book provides a concise and famously rigorous treatment of the subject, making it a valuable reference to accompany any real analysis course. However, be prepared for its characteristic terseness. Rudin's writing style is exceptionally concise and minimalist, sometimes to the point of being quite challenging for those new to the material. The narrative depth it might lack can often be supplemented by exploring other excellent books on real analysis, such as **Understanding Analysis** by Stephen Abbott or **Real Mathematical Analysis** by Charles Pugh.

Another notable and more contemporary treatment of real analysis comes from Terence Tao with his **Analysis I & II**. These volumes offer a comprehensive, honors-level approach. A key feature of Tao's style here is that many lemmas and corollaries are left as exercises for the reader. For someone already seasoned in analysis (who can often "eyeball" the logic of a proof), this can be an engaging way to learn. For a beginner, however, this can become quite frustrating. It's also worth noting that Tao's presentation is quite "barebones"—it focuses laser-like on what's essential for an undergraduate analysis textbook, with minimal detours.

This is where, for many, Charles Pugh's **Real Mathematical Analysis** truly shines and offers a different kind of experience. I'd particularly highlight Pugh for his signature intuitive approach and his fantastic (and sometimes incredibly tough!) problem sets. You'll find exercise after exercise brimming with exciting ideas from the rich "buffet" of analysis. It’s a rewarding read not just for building rigor, but for mathematical culture as well. That said, Pugh expects a fair degree of self-sufficiency in proving things; there isn't a lot of hand-holding. A practical tip: with the sheer volume of problems, you'll likely want to be selective with your choices.

If you aren't yet comfortable with constructing proofs independently, then diving straight into Pugh might be a very steep climb. In that situation, Stephen Abbott's **Understanding Analysis** often proves to be a more accommodating starting point. It's an excellent book that builds understanding effectively without demanding the same level of prior proof-writing fluency that Pugh presumes.

## Other Topics and Outliers
A very interesting book I found and used to a large extent in high school was **'An Infinitely Large Napkin'** by Evan Chen. It is a very good book spanning a wide range of topics, including linear & abstract algebra, algebraic & point-set topology, algebraic geometry, various flavors of analysis & measure theory, and more. It has a signature conversational style that makes it easy to read and understand, and it is a great resource for anyone interested in satisfying their curiosity about higher mathematics.

To avoid paraphrasing the intention of the textbook, I will cite the Preamble:
> I’ll be eating a quick lunch with some friends of mine who are still in high school. They’ll ask me what I’ve been up to the last few weeks, and I’ll tell them that I’ve been learning category theory. They’ll ask me what category theory is about. I tell them it’s about abstracting things by looking at just the structure-preserving morphisms between them, rather than the objects themselves. I’ll try to give them the standard example Gp, but then I’ll realize that they don’t know what a homomorphism is. So then I’ll start trying to explain what a homomorphism is, but then I’ll remember that they haven’t learned what a group is. So then I’ll start trying to explain what a group is, but by the time I finish writing the group axioms on my napkin, they’ve already forgotten why I was talking about groups in the first place. And then it’s 1PM, people need to go places, and I can’t help but think:
> *Man, if I had forty hours instead of forty minutes, I bet I could actually have explained this all.*
> This book is my attempt at those forty hours.

In addition to overviews like this, I would recommend spending time working through foundational material from established textbooks. This involves reading various textbooks and working through the majority of the exercises: it takes longer, but you build a solid, more sustainable foundation this way.

## Information Theory
Information theory being one of my fields of choice, I will pay special attention to this section.

The classic coverage of information theory would be **'Elements of Information Theory'** by Joy A. Thomas and Thomas M. Cover. Excellent coverage of all the fundamentals in information theory, and I found it relatively approachable. It does assume knowledge of probability and statistics, but that is to be expected.

It would also be a good idea to supplement this with Claude Shannon's original paper, i.e. **'A Mathematical Theory of Communication'**. Shannon's original paper is IMPRESSIVELY readable and comprehensive, even 50+ years later, and is a great supplement to a more modern book covering more ideas.
